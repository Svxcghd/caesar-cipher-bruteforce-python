# caesar-cipher-bruteforce-python
The Caesar cipher is a basic substitution cipher where each letter is shifted by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet. Because it has only 25 possible shifts, it can be easily broken using brute force. This script tests all possible shifts and prints each result so the correct plaintext can be identified.
